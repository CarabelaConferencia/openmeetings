    Class editRecordStream
    
    Description:
    This Class shows a window where you can alter you Video-/Microphone- Input-Resources
    and start to stream. The app could also use the default values for Cam/Mic but
    must users don't know how to alter this (wether in System-Control-Panel or by Right Clicking
    on the Flash-Screen and *>Preferences>Camera* )
    So I think it is better if Users are forced to choose something from this list
