			<p>To import .doc, .docx, .odp, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, ... [ all files that you can open with OpenOffice ] 
            to OpenMeetings and use them in the whiteboard you need OpenOffice as Service running on 
				the machine that runs OpenMeetings.<br/>
			</p>
			<p>Converter works with both: OpenOffice or LibreOffice.</p>
			<p>You should use an OpenOffice version greater 3</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Linux (Debian, et cetera): You have to start OpenOffice in "headless" modus. This requires NO graphical user interface on the server! 
                    So there is no need to install xvfb or anything like that. However you should install ALL OpenOffice packages, 
					for example if you want to enable the .xls, .xlsx import you need to install the openoffice-calc package.<br/>
					You can start OpenOffice Service with this command: <br/>
					<tt>/path/to/openoffice/program/soffice.bin -headless -nofirststartwizard -accept="socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;StarOffice.Service" </tt>
					<br/>
					It might makes sense to install ms-corefonts package on Linux machines to have MS fonts available.
				</li>
				<li>for Mac OS X: <tt>/path/to/openoffice.app/Contents/!MacOS/soffice.bin -headless -nofirststartwizard -accept="socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;StarOffice.Service"</tt> 
				</li>
				<li>for Windows: <tt>soffice.exe -headless -nofirststartwizard -accept="socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;StarOffice.Service"</tt> </li>
			</ul>
