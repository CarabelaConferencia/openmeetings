				</div>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Step1 - Prepare files">
				<p>
					Check that all files:
					<br />
					LICENSE, NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, CHANGELOG, README
					<br />
					are up to date and refer to the right version.
				</p>

				<p>
					Create a TAG of the SVN tree that you would like to release
				</p>

				<p>Get the source from your TAG: </p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					svn checkout
					https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/openmeetings/$TREE/$BRANCHORTAG/
					<br />
					$TREE and $BRANCHORTAG should be replaced with your new TAG
				</div>

				<p>Edit the file build.properties</p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					project.status=SNAPSHOT
				</div>
				<p>to</p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					project.status=RELEASE
				</div>
				<p>Run the command: </p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					ant dist-release
				</div>
				<p>Test building the source on windows and OSx or Linux</p>
				<p>Test running the binary's</p>
				<p>Create MD5 checksums</p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					#On OSX you might use this command to make a MD5 checksum and store
					it to a file
					<br />
					md5 -r apache-openmeetings-XXX-src.zip >
					apache-openmeetings-XXX-src.zip.md5
				</div>
				<p>
					Create signatures with the your KEY for every file, the KEY must be
					available at:
					<br />
					<a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/openmeetings/KEYS">http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/openmeetings/KEYS
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>Upload the build artefacts to your public_html in your home
					directory at people.apache.org
				</p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					#On OSX you might use this command to upload the file
					<br />
					scp apache-openmeetings-XXXX.zip
					sebawagner@people.apache.org:~/public_html/
				</div>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Step2 - VOTE and RESULT emails">
				<p>
					Send a "VOTE" to the developer mailing list including links to
					release artefacts.
					<br />
					A VOTE always contains two parts:
					<br />
					Send an email to the developer mailing list with the subject line:
					<br />
					[VOTE] Apache OpenMeetings x.xx Incubating release
					<br />
					An example for such an email:
					<a
						href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-openmeetings-dev/201207.mbox/%3CCACeMiA9dXXMnxA3EhJVPGhpvO4z2cLNqHVP7uOhSHT8e_vHoFQ%40mail.gmail.com%3E">example Vote email</a>
					<br />
					Forward (Not CC) this Vote email to: private@incubator.apache.org
					<br />
					<br />
					After the vote is over, send a "RESULT" email to the list with the
					subject line:
					<br />
					[RESULT][VOTE] Apache OpenMeetings x.xx Incubating release
					<br />
					An example for such an email:
					<a
						href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-openmeetings-dev/201207.mbox/%3CCACeMiA-ibo6fGCbnLjJX9H5H2kFGDVJRMfxPyMtzWzCWNi%2BpOg%40mail.gmail.com%3E">example Result email</a>
					<br />
					Forward (Not CC) this RESULT VOTE email to:
					private@incubator.apache.org
					<br />
					<br />
					After the Vote was successful on the Developer mailing list,
					you need organize a vote on the general list:
					general@incubator.apache.org
					<br />
					The vote on the general list has the same process, first a VOTE
					email, then a RESULT email.
					<br />
					You need at least 3 IPMC votes for the release. You can summarize
					the IPMC votes from both votes (dev + general).
				</p>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Step3 - Distribute and announce">
				<p>If VOTEs positive: Upload the release </p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					The distribution upload location (www.apache.org/dist)
					for all Apache projects is the /www/www.apache.org/dist directory on
					people.apache.org. Each project (including the Incubator) owns a
					directory within dist.
				</div>
				<p>
					Our distribution directory is:
					<br/>
					/www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/openmeetings
					<br/>
					each version should have a subfolder within this directory matching the name of the release:
					<br/>
					for example 2.0-incubating
				</p>
				<p>
					Wait 24 hours (until all Apache mirrors have synced the packages)
					and send an announcement to the mailing list + blog and any other
					channel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Email announcements should have the subject line:
					<br />
					[ANNOUNCE] Apache OpenMeetings x.xx [Incubating] released
				</p>
				<p>
					Add a section to <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> website. 
					<br/>
					Make sure that the binary packages are linked using the mirror URL as base path (<b>not</b> www.apache.org/dist):
					<br/>
					Mirror URL: <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/openmeetings/">http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/openmeetings/</a>
				</p>
